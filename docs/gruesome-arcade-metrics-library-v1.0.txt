Purpose
- This is the canonical list of “metric IDs” your games can submit in ARCADE:RUN_RESULT.
- Each game chooses:
  - defaultMetric (what the Skill leaderboard ranks by for that game)
  - metrics[] (what the UI can switch between)
  - direction per metric (asc/desc), and clamp (anti-cheat & sanity)
- Activity rewards are NOT based on these metrics. Activity uses paid Credits spent + active days.
  (Skill = leaderboard; Activity = participation.)

Metric schema (public/arcade-metrics-library.json)
- id: stable identifier used in payloads and URLs
- label: human-readable display label
- kind:
  - counter: integer “more is better” (usually)
  - duration: time values (ms)
  - ratio: a normalized value (often basis points)
  - currency: arcade Credits (AC) style integer counters
  - composite: derived (server or client computed)
- direction:
  - desc: higher ranks better (score, waves, accuracy)
  - asc: lower ranks better (timeMs, damageTaken)
- format:
  - int: integer count
  - ms: milliseconds
  - bp: basis points (0–10000 = 0–100.00%)
  - ac: arcade credits (integer)

Important constraints
- Clamp: The server may clamp metric values to a min/max range for safety.
- One run = one payload: submit all metrics you can in ARCADE:RUN_RESULT once, on game over.
- Game-type aware: A “defaultMetric” must match the game’s core skill expression.
  Example: speedrun → timeMs (asc), defense → waves (desc), shooter → score or accuracyBp.

Recommended metric patterns by game type (generic)
- Endless survival / defense: durationMs (desc), waves (desc), score (desc), efficiency (desc), damageTaken (asc)
- Speedrun / time trial: timeMs (asc), deaths (asc), retries (asc), accuracyBp (desc)
- Accuracy / precision: accuracyBp (desc), shotsHit (desc), misses (asc), combo (desc)
- Puzzle / strategy: moves (asc), mistakes (asc), completionBp (desc), timeMs (asc)
- Economy-in-run games (Credits affect outcome):
  - Include spentInRunAC and purchasesInRun.
  - Use rankedSpendCapAC in arcade-games.json (prevents whale domination).
  - Prefer “efficiency” style defaultMetric (outcome per spend) when appropriate.

Notes
- Your public/arcade-games.json should only reference metric IDs that exist in this library.
- Tools:
  - tools/validate-arcade-catalog-metrics.mjs (schema + references)
  - tools/apply-game-profile.mjs (apply genre profiles to games)
