This is the operational spec for launch: what exists, what is locked, and how payouts work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Membership (PRO) Tiers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tier 0: Free
- Can play free/demo modes
- If game charges run cost: Free must pay the run cost (no free runs unless explicitly allowed)

Tier 1: $2 Monthly
- PRO status for 30 days
- Unlocks Avatar Studio + Gen1 base avatar mint
- Access to achievements that reward small amounts of Credits
- Eligible for certain promos/airdrops (policy-based)

Tier 2: $25 Monthly
- Same as Tier 1
- +10% bonus on payouts (policy-based)
- Free entry to tournaments
- Airdrop eligibility

Tier 3: $100 “Lifetime until Jan 30, 2026; after that annual”
- One-time payment until Jan 30, 2026 00:00 UTC
- After that date: Tier 3 renewals are annual

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2) PRO Avatar NFT (Gen1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase A constraints:
- Single token collection
- One per wallet
- Membership status stored in contract state
- Mint is permanent lock at launch (SBT behavior)
- Nickname can be set at mint and is visible in wallets + leaderboards + public places while SBT-active
- Admin can later unlock transfers permanently (Gen1 becomes tradeable collectible)

Important:
- When transfers are unlocked, membership logic still lives by wallet address (Phase A).
  Treat the NFT primarily as a collectible unless membership is redesigned to follow ownership.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Credits (AC) Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Two balances:
- Paid Credits (paid AC)
- Promo Credits (promo AC)

Rules:
- Skill payouts are based on PAID-ELIGIBLE leaderboards (paid spend required).
- Promo/free runs can appear on “global” boards but do not earn Skill pool by default.
- Activity pool is based on paid spend + active days (not raw score).

In-run spend games (economy-dynamic):
- must set rankedSpendCapAC
- must report inRunSpendAC
- should provide an efficiency metric

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Payouts
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Daily:
- Epoch settles at UTC midnight.
- Claim is user-gas-paid (mUSD claim tx, or Web2 claim depending on deployment).

Weekly:
- Weekly reserve is funded by a percentage of daily flows.
- Recommended reserve: 15% of daily.
- Weekly settlement runs Monday 00:05 UTC.
- Weekly claims are separate from daily claims.

Pools (daily):
- 50% Skill (rank-based, paid-eligible only)
- 35% Activity (paid activity score)
- 10% PRO boost pool
- Lottery is funded by 8% of Activity + extra 5% moved from Skill (policy)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Admin Transparency Policy (critical)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Admin mode:
- Admin wallet is hardcoded in the frontend AND enforced server-side.
- Admin identity (nickname/avatar) can be displayed publicly for transparency.
- Admin wallet does NOT receive payouts.
- If admin places in a paid-eligible leaderboard slot, payouts roll down to the next eligible player.

Admin data spine:
- GET /api/admin/snapshot (admin-only)
- This powers the admin overlay in your 3D metrics map.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Minimum Launch-Ready Checklist
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Wallet: connect + buy credits + membership + claim daily + claim weekly
[ ] Leaderboard: multi-metric + paid-eligible views + identity hover
[ ] Games: run gating + run result posting (Moonshot done; apply to others)
[ ] Catalog: every game declares defaultMetric + metrics[]
[ ] Admin: payout excluded + snapshot endpoint working

END
