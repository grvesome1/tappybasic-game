Last updated: 2026-01-05

built by gruesøme

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0) What changed in v1.1 (delta)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Weekly payout reserve: a % of daily net pot rolls into a weekly pot.
- Multi-metric, game-type-aware leaderboards (catalog-defined metrics).
- PRO Avatar nickname at mint (public display).
- Gen1 PRO Avatar: launch as SBT, with an admin one-way unlock to tradable later.
- Wallet UX: daily + weekly countdowns + claim flows (UI supports fallback to API routes).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) User types & PRO tiers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Free user
- Can play games.
- Can earn leaderboard placement (for fun), but payouts require eligible (paid) activity.

PRO membership is a single ERC-721 (“PRO Avatar NFT”)
- One per wallet.
- Membership status stored on-chain: tier + expiry.
- Avatar image is locked permanently once minted (no edit system for Gen1).

Tiers (launch)
- PRO Mini: $2/mo
  - Unlocks Avatar Studio access (mint)
  - Eligible for small achievement Credit rewards
- PRO Prime: $25/mo
  - +10% payout bonus
  - Free entry to tournaments
  - Eligible for Credit airdrops (if any)
- PRO Lifetime: $100
  - “Lifetime until Jan 30, 2026; after that annual” (contract rule: after lifetimeSaleEnd it becomes annual)

Nickname
- User provides a nickname at mint.
- Nickname is public while PRO is active and shown on leaderboards and other public surfaces.

Transferability
- Launch default: Soulbound (SBT) — transfers & approvals revert.
- Future: admin can permanently unlock transfers for Gen1 collectibles when the ecosystem migrates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Credits economy (AC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 1 Credit (AC) is an off-chain unit anchored to $0.01 for UX.
- Users buy Credits using ETH (chain tx); backend credits the account.
- Games do not own balances. Arcade parent does.

Promos
- Promo Credits can exist.
- Promo runs may appear on “fun boards” but are not payout eligible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Leaderboards & payouts (daily + weekly)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaderboards are populated by run submissions (server authoritative):
- Daily, Weekly, All-time leaderboards exist per game and per metric.
- “Eligible (paid-only)” boards are used for skill payouts.

Payout pipeline (daily epoch)
- Epoch settles at UTC midnight.
- Net pot = (paid Credits spent) minus platform take.
- Default splits (launch):
  - 55% Skill pool (rank-based, paid-only eligible)
  - 35% Activity pool (based on paid Credits spent + active days)
  - 10% PRO boost pool (weighted, PRO-only)

Weekly reserve
- A percentage of each day’s net pot is reserved into a weekly pot.
- Weekly pot is claimable after weekly settlement (Mon 00:05 UTC by cron).
- Default weekly reserve: 15% (configurable).

Lottery (optional at launch)
- Funded from Activity pool (configurable %).
- Winners are chosen weighted by paid activity.
- If nobody qualifies, lottery can roll back to Activity.

Fairness: economy-heavy games
- If a game spends Credits during the run:
  - track inRunSpendAC metric
  - enforce rankedSpendCapAC for eligible boards
  - provide “ranked vs sandbox” modes if needed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Contracts (launch set)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArcadePayments.sol
- Accepts ETH, forwards to treasury, credits user off-chain via backend.

ArcadePromo.sol
- Promo allocations and claims (optional; can be disabled at launch).

ArcadeEpochVault.sol
- Holds reward token (mUSD / stable).
- Pays out claims based on backend settlement totals.

ArcadeProAvatar.sol (v1.2)
- PRO membership + avatar ERC-721
- One per wallet, status stored in contract
- Nickname stored once at mint
- Transfers locked by default; admin one-way unlock possible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Admin transparency goals (planned)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Admin wallet appears on leaderboards (with “ADMIN” badge) but is excluded from payouts.
If an admin wallet places in a payout position, rewards shift to the next eligible player.

Admin page (future iteration)
- Visible only for admin wallet
- Shows vault + treasury balances, epoch totals
- Allows deposit/withdraw (with on-chain tx) and “read-only” audit links

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
