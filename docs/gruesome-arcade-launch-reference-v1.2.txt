This document is the “what happens at launch” reference for:
- Credits (paid + promo)
- Leaderboards (skill + activity)
- Epoch settlement (daily + weekly reserve)
- Payout claiming UX
- PRO avatar + nickname identity

1) Economy
Credits are the Arcade’s in-app unit:
- Paid Credits: purchased with ETH
- Promo Credits: granted by promotions/airdrops
- Only paid Credits make a run payout-eligible for Skill rewards.

2) Run types
A run is a parent-authorized session:
- runId: unique ID issued by Arcade
- costAC: how many credits are consumed up-front or reserved
- eligible: whether this run counts for Skill payouts (paid-only)

Games must be gated behind ARCADE:RUN_GRANTED in embedded mode.

3) Leaderboards (v2)
There are multiple leaderboards:
- Skill (per game):
  - ranked by selected metric (defaultMetric per game)
  - periods: daily / weekly / all-time
  - eligibility: paid-only board for payouts
- Activity (global):
  - weighted by paid Credits spent and active days
  - used for Activity payouts and PRO/Lottery weights

Multi-metric support:
- Each game defines allowed metrics in arcade-games.json.
- Metric IDs come from arcade-metrics-library.json.

4) Metrics & fairness
Arcade is built to be “equitable, not equal”:
- Different game types express skill differently.
- The system supports:
  - speed metrics (timeMs, asc)
  - endurance metrics (durationMs, desc)
  - precision metrics (accuracyBp, desc)
  - efficiency metrics (efficiency, desc)
  - economy-in-run metrics (spentInRunAC, purchasesInRun) with caps

Guardrails (anti-whale / anti-cheat)
- clamp (min/max) per metric
- direction (asc/desc) is explicit per metric
- rankedSpendCapAC for games where credits affect outcomes

5) Epoch settlement + payouts
Daily:
- Settles at UTC midnight.
- Splits pot into:
  - Skill pool (paid-only skill leaderboard ranks)
  - Activity pool (paid activity ZSET weights)
  - PRO boost pool
  - Lottery pool (subset of activity + optional transfers)

Weekly:
- A reserve percentage of daily pots can be rolled into weekly payouts.
- Weekly skill uses weekly paid-only leaderboards.
- Weekly activity uses weekly activity weights.

Wallet UX:
- Show Daily + Weekly countdowns and claimables.
- Provide claim buttons (Tx) for each.

6) Identity (nickname + PRO avatar)
Nickname:
- Set at mint time or via profile endpoint (set-once).
- Displayed publicly on leaderboards when active.

PRO avatar:
- NFT / SBT-based avatar system.
- Leaderboard hover can display avatarPng when present.

7) Transparency / admin
Recommended admin behavior:
- Admin can appear on leaderboards with a distinct identity (nickname + avatar),
  but must be excluded from payouts.
- When an excluded account places in payout positions, the payout should roll down
  to the next eligible rank.
