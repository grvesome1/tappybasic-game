FOCUS OF v2.7
- Fix trait browser scrolling (traits now scroll inside the Traits room).
- Placement-first tuning using category + per-trait offsets (no asset rework required).
- Removed drawn “arms” (no sleeve-lines). Hands only, with improved glove pixel sprites.
- UI cleanup + better room layout consistency.

NOTES
- All traits remain unlocked (no leveling/achievements).
- "Mint (lock)" freezes the current DNA + selection inside this app (localStorage). Real immutability comes from on-chain minting.
