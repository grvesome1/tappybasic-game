# Archive: legacy-2026-01-07

This folder contains legacy/non-runtime materials that were moved out of the repo root to reduce clutter.

Safety notes:
- Vercel serves this project from `public/` and `api/`.
- Everything moved here is intended to be non-runtime (historical iterations, pitch decks, legacy docs, and old tooling snapshots).
- If something was moved prematurely, it can be restored by moving it back to the repo root.
