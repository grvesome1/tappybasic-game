PARTNER PITCH OVERVIEW (REPO-VERIFIED)
=====================================

What this is
------------
This workspace is an integration kit for Gruesøme Arcade’s on-chain payments + payout plumbing:
- A universal on-chain payments router that verifies backend-signed EIP-712 quotes
- Treasury custody for non-stablecoin receipts
- Epoch-based payouts via Merkle-claim vaults
- Scripts + TypeScript packages to deploy, validate manifests, and integrate safely

Anything that depends on deployed contract state is marked: VERIFY ON-CHAIN.

What partners get (high level)
------------------------------
- One consistent on-chain receipt model across SKUs (router executes purchases and emits canonical receipts)
- Configurable routing by SKU kind (splits/recipients are admin-managed; VERIFY ON-CHAIN for live values)
- Multi-asset payments with stablecoin-based solvency (direct stablecoin funding vs treasury custody; VERIFY ON-CHAIN)
- Scalable payouts (Merkle epoch publishing + many claims)
- Operational tooling included (deploy/verify scripts, UI config export, accepted payments listing, epoch ops)

What’s concrete and verifiable in this repo today
-------------------------------------------------
- SSOT manifest schema exists (deployments/manifest.schema.json)
- Per-network manifest files exist (deployments/arcade.lineaSepolia.json, deployments/arcade.lineaMainnet.json)
- The EIP-712 Quote “shape” is specified (domain name/version and field list)
- Scripts exist to export UI config and discover accepted payments from a deployed router

Important current-state note
----------------------------
The manifests in this repo currently contain placeholder/zero addresses and template timestamps.
Do not treat them as “already deployed” until they are populated by a real deployment.

Purchase flow (partner mental model)
------------------------------------
1) Frontend requests a signed quote from the backend.
2) Frontend submits quote + signature to the router.
3) Router verifies signature/buyer/expiry/replay-protection. (VERIFY ON-CHAIN for signer + router address)
4) Router routes funds and emits a receipt. (VERIFY ON-CHAIN for routing/splits/token allowlist)
5) Backend indexes receipts for fulfillment and settlement.

VERIFY ON-CHAIN BEFORE PUBLISHING (addresses/tokens/percentages)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Before publishing partner-facing “live deployment” details:
- Router address (EIP-712 verifyingContract)
- Quote signer address configured on the router
- Accepted token allowlist and current accepted tokens
- Current routing/splits per kind
- Ownership/role handoff status
