ADMIN ADVISORY OVERVIEW (REPO-VERIFIED)
======================================

Audience
--------
Operators/admins responsible for deploying, configuring, and running the Arcade integration kit.

This doc stays intentionally conservative:
- Splits/routing are configurable; do not publish exact percentages unless verified on-chain.

Operational primitives (what you control)
-----------------------------------------
VERIFY ON-CHAIN:
- Quote signer address (backend signing authority)
- Accepted ERC-20 token allowlist
- Routing/splits per kind
- Ownership/role handoff (final admin / multisig)
- Treasury custody and any automation/keeper configuration

Manifests as SSOT (after deploy)
--------------------------------
- This repo includes a manifest schema and per-network manifests.
- Current repo manifests contain placeholder/zero addresses and template timestamps.
- After real deployment, treat the populated per-network manifest as SSOT for:
  - contract addresses
  - chainId + explorer metadata
  - EIP-712 domain fields
  - recorded role addresses

Key management (high priority)
------------------------------
- Keep the quote signer private key in hardened secrets storage.
- Use short quote expiries to minimize risk from leaked quotes.
- Prefer multisig ownership for admin privileges.
- Plan a signer-rotation procedure (requires on-chain update; VERIFY ON-CHAIN).

Admin workflows (scripts exist in this repo)
--------------------------------------------
- Deploy + verify (Hardhat scripts)
- Export UI config / accepted payments (reads router state; VERIFY ON-CHAIN)
- Configure per-kind routing/splits (VERIFY ON-CHAIN)
- Epoch publishing (Merkle build + publish; VERIFY ON-CHAIN balances and permissions)

VERIFY ON-CHAIN BEFORE PUBLISHING ANY “LIVE” CLAIMS
---------------------------------------------------
- Deployed contract addresses (router/vaults/pro/promo)
- EIP-712 verifyingContract equals deployed router address
- Quote signer address configured on the router
- Accepted tokens list and allowlist flags
- Current routing/splits by kind
- Ownership/role handoff completed

Positive incident-response pointers
-----------------------------------
- Signature issues: re-check chainId + verifyingContract + signer alignment (VERIFY ON-CHAIN).
- Token issues: disable token allowlist entry (VERIFY ON-CHAIN) and re-export UI config.
- Payout issues: pause new epoch publishing, validate Merkle inputs, confirm vault balances (VERIFY ON-CHAIN).
