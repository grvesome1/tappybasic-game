CONCISE RUNBOOK FOR THE OTHER MACHINE (ARCADE REPO ONLY)
=======================================================

Goal: collect JUST the Arcade repo facts needed to wire the vendored integration-kit correctly.

Important:
- This other machine is ONLY used to inspect the main Arcade repo (gruesomes.arcade).
- Do NOT run integration-kit scripts here.
- Do NOT paste secrets/private keys (none of the requested outputs should contain them).

What you do on the other machine:
1) Open a terminal in the Arcade repo root (gruesomes.arcade).
2) Run EXACTLY the commands in Part B below.
3) Paste back the full outputs for B1, B2, B3, B4, and B6.

---

PART B: ARCADE REPO FACTS (RUN THESE 5 COMMANDS)
===============================================

# B1: Root listing
Get-ChildItem -Force | Select-Object Name

# B2: Package manager lockfile detection
Get-ChildItem -Force pnpm-lock.yaml,yarn.lock,package-lock.json 2>$null | Select-Object Name

# B3: CI workflows inventory
Get-ChildItem .github\workflows -Filter *.yml -Force 2>$null | Select-Object Name

# B4: Top-level package.json
Get-Content package.json -Raw

# B6: Watermark/signature policy check (paths only)
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
	Where-Object { $_.Name -match 'watermark|signature|xor|built' } |
	Select-Object -First 20 FullName

---

WHAT TO PASTE BACK (SINGLE BUNDLE)
=================================

Paste back a single bundle with these sections (in this exact order):

1) B1 output: root listing
2) B2 output: which lockfile exists (if any)
3) B3 output: workflow .yml filenames (or "none")
4) B4 output: full package.json (raw)
5) B6 output: first 20 watermark/signature/xor/built path matches

Once you paste that bundle back, I can generate the minimal Arcade repo follow-up patch list without guessing.

Note:
- Post-migration evidence (like arcade-integration-kit/MIGRATION_REPORT.md) is produced by running the integration prompt
	in PROMPT_INTEGRATE_REPO_CLEANLY_AND_SAFELY.txt, not by this runbook.
